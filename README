# This is the README file for Proto-Quipper.

Prerequisites
=============

The following are required to compile Proto-Quipper:

* The GHC Haskell compiler (tested with version 7.4.2)

* Alex and Happy (lexer and parser for Haskell)

* The Haskell readline library.  Note: this is not required on the
  Windows operating system. On all other operating systems, it can be
  installed with:

  cabal install readline

Building
========

In the top-level directory, type "make".

Description
===========

Synopsis: ProtoQuipper [OPTION] .. [FILE] ..
  Types and interprets FILEs, or if no FILE is given, run the interactive mode.

-t, --type
    don't run the interpreter.

-r, --run
    run the interpret (default mode).

-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
    change the circuit output format. Implemented formats are
      * "visual": display the circuit on the standard output
      * "ir": print the Intermediate Representation of the circuit

-i DIR, --include=DIR
    include the directory

-h, --help
    display this help and exit

-V, --version
    output version and exit

-v [LVL], --verbose[=LVL]
    change the verbose level


Interactive Mode
================

The interactive mode accepts the commands:

:help        -- Show the list of commands
:exit        -- Quit the interactive mode
:path <dir>  -- Add a directory to the current module path
:type <exp>  -- Show the type of an expression
:context     -- List the variables of the current context
:display     -- Display the toplevel circuit


User guide
==========

For a tutorial introduction to Proto-Quipper, see Section 8,
"Proto-Quipper user guide", of the Proto-Quipper report.


Browsing the documentation and source code
==========================================

While it is possible the browse the Proto-Quipper source code in a
text editor, it is much nicer to browse the documented source by
pointing your web browser to doc/frames.html in this Proto-Quipper
distribution. The documented source is fully cross-referenced and
indexed, with links to color-coded raw source files.


Building the documentation
==========================

If the programs "haddock" and "HsColour" are installed, the
documentation can be built with "make haddock".
